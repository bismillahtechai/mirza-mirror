# Mirza Mirror: Requirements Analysis

## Overview
Based on the conversation between the user and ChatGPT, the user is looking for a system to externalize, organize, and retrieve thoughts. The system is called "Mirza Mirror" and is intended to be an AI-powered thought capture and organization tool, with a preference for an iPhone app interface.

## Core Problem
The user has multiple ways to capture thoughts (voice notes on iPhone, notes on iPhone, voice notes on computer, notes on computer, ChatGPT conversations) but lacks:
1. A unified system to capture everything
2. A way to organize captured thoughts
3. A retrieval mechanism to find and use past thoughts
4. A system with memory and AI to help organize everything

## Key Requirements

### 1. Capture Layer
- **Multi-modal input**: Voice notes, text notes, ChatGPT conversations
- **Zero friction capture**: Easy to use, always available
- **Cross-device support**: Primary focus on iPhone, but should work with computer inputs too

### 2. Processing Layer
- **Transcription**: Convert voice notes to text using Whisper
- **AI-powered tagging**: Automatically categorize thoughts by project, theme, emotion, domain
- **Linking**: Connect related thoughts using semantic similarity
- **Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of longer thoughts

### 3. Memory Layer
- **Centralized storage**: All thoughts stored in a single database
- **Persistent memory**: Thoughts are never lost
- **Structured data**: Each thought has metadata (tags, timestamp, source, etc.)

### 4. Agent Layer
- **Tagging Agent**: Classifies thoughts by project, emotion, category
- **Linking Agent**: Connects related thoughts
- **Reflection Agent**: Identifies patterns, generates insights
- **Action Agent**: Extracts tasks, suggests follow-ups

### 5. Retrieval Layer
- **Search**: Find thoughts by keyword, tag, project, emotion
- **Daily digest**: AI-curated summary of important thoughts
- **Project view**: See all thoughts related to a specific project
- **Emotional processing**: Identify patterns in emotional thoughts

### 6. User Interface
- **iPhone app**: Primary interface for the system
- **Quick capture**: Easy to record voice or text notes
- **Browse interface**: View and search past thoughts
- **Daily mirror**: See AI-generated reflections and insights

## Technical Requirements
- **Backend**: Python-based with FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or SQLite + Chroma for vector search
- **AI**: OpenAI Assistants API or LangChain for agents
- **Transcription**: OpenAI Whisper API
- **Frontend**: SwiftUI or React Native + Expo for iPhone app

## User Experience Goals
- **Effortless capture**: No friction when recording thoughts
- **Intelligent organization**: AI does the work of organizing
- **Meaningful retrieval**: Thoughts surface when they're relevant
- **Emotional intelligence**: System understands emotional context
- **Learning system**: Gets better the more it's used

## Constraints
- **Privacy**: Personal thoughts require strong privacy measures
- **Offline capability**: Should work without internet for basic capture
- **Battery efficiency**: Mobile app should be battery-friendly
- **Cost efficiency**: Optimize API usage to manage costs

## Success Criteria
- User can capture thoughts in any format without friction
- System automatically organizes thoughts without user effort
- User can easily find past thoughts when needed
- System provides meaningful insights and patterns
- User feels the system truly understands their thinking patterns
